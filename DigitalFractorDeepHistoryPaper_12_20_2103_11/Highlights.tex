{\bf Highlights}
\begin{itemize}
\item We add long term memory to the Grunwald differintegral by averaging the history.
\item Time can most successfully be binned exponentially, with longer bins toward the past.
\item The algorithm scales as the number of bins in memory and time during run time. 
\item Simulations show a factor of 3 gain in constant phase bandwidth for 10 bins over the IIR.
\item There is a 2 to 2.5 decade gain in bandwidth for 20 bins over the Infinite Impulse Response.

\end{itemize}
