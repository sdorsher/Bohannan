%%%% Abstract %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 \begin{abstract}

This paper outlines a method to achieve effective bandwidth of five or
more decades in the approximation of a fractional order
derivative. This constitutes an increase of two decades or more over
current algorithms, such the Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) method
based on continued fraction expansion, while demanding only slightly
more computational steps and processor memory.

{\bf No outline in the template. Should we cut this?}
\paragraph{Outline\\}
We will first briefly describe the current state of the art in
fractional order operator approximation and then describe a novel
approach based on successive binning of older data.

\begin{itemize} 
\item Section~\ref{sec:algorithmDefn} will contain algorithm definitions. 
\item Section~\ref{sec:bode} will contain the amplitude and phase response
  of these algorithms for a large and small number of bins in the
  partition.
\item Section~\ref{sec:computation} will contain an analysis of the
  computational resources required for the larger versus the smaller
  number of memory registers stored.
\end{itemize}

\setcounter{equation}{0}

The computational efficiency of each algorithm concerns both the
memory used by the algorithm and the number of computational steps
required for the algorithm to execute, which is a measure of the
speed. To characterize the operational efficiency of a digital fractor
operating as a circuit element in real time, the quantities of
interest are the memory or number of processor steps {/em per time
  step}.
