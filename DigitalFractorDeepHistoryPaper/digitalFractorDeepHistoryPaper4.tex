 \begin{abstract}

This paper outlines a method to achieve effective bandwidth of five or
more decades in the approximation of a fractional order
derivative. This constitutes an increase of two decades or more over
current algorithms, such the Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) method
based on continued fraction expansion, while demanding only slightly
more computational steps and processor memory.

\paragraph{Outline\\}
We will first briefly describe the current state of the art in
fractional order operator approximation and then describe a novel
approach based on successive binning of older data.

\begin{itemize} 
\item Section~\ref{sec:algorithmDefn} will contain algorithm definitions. 
\item  Section~\ref{sec:computation} will contain an analysis of the
  computational resources required for the larger versus the smaller
  number of memory registers stored.
\item Section~\ref{sec:methods} will contain a description of the
  numerical simulation written to verify the algorithm described in
  Section~\ref{sec:algorithmDefn}.
\item Section~\ref{sec:bode} will contain the amplitude and phase response
  of these algorithms for a large and small number of bins in the
  partition.
\end{itemize}
