While the algorithms described in Section~\ref{sec:algorithmDefn} are
ultimately intended for use in a digital fractor, in order to
characterize their frequency response we have simulated them in C++ on a
personal computer. The relative phase as a function of frequency is based upon the
fractional derivative or integral of sinusoidal inputs, sweeping from
low frequency to high frequency in logarithmic steps. Relative phase
is reconsted using a Numerical Recipes in C algorithm to fit the last
half of the output signal to the sine and cosine components of a
sinusoidal signal with the same frequency as the input signal. 
\begin{equation}
\phi^\prime = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{B}{C}\right)
\label{eqn:initialPhase}
\end{equation}
gives the phase relative to an input cosine function over $-90^\circ$
to $90^\circ$, where $B$ is the sine component and $C$ is the cosine
component of the fit. The following equation adjusts the relative
phase to account for all four quadrants and to be relative to the
input sine wave.
{\bf ACTUALLY USE ATAN2. FIX FIGURES OR FIX EQUATION}
\begin{equation}%actually use atan2. is this right?
\phi = 
\begin{cases} \phi^\prime+\frac{3\pi}{2}, &\mbox{if } B>0 \mbox{, } C<0\\
\phi^\prime +\frac{\pi}{2}, &\mbox{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\label{eqn:phases}
\end{equation}
To verify phase reconstruction, we examine the phase shift of a single
crossing in the time domain for an input frequency of $0.7924$ Hz
(Figures~\ref{fig:timeDomain}~and~\ref{fig:zoomTimeDomain}). Table~\ref{tab:phaseRecon}
shows a comparison of reconstructed phases using the sinusoidal fit
method and phases obtained from Figure~\ref{fig:zoomTimeDomain} by
measuring the phase difference in a single zero-crossing.

  steps and a duration of $10.0$ s, with 10 terms in the Continued Fraction
  Expansion (CFE) and 10 bins in the binned Grunwald approach. A
  variety of binning methods were used: truncated simple Grunwald
  (GL), linearly increasing bin sizes (LIN), bin sizes increasing as a
  square (SQ), exponentially increasing bin sizes (EXP), and bin sizes
  following a Fibbonacci rule (FIB).}

Reconstructed and zero-crossing phases are shown in Table~\ref{tab:phaseRecon}. In this plot, the duration was $10.0$ s and there were $1000$ time steps.

Amplitude is reconstructed according to the following equation. 

\begin{equation}
A = \sqrt{B^2+C^2}.
\label{eqn:amplitude}
\end{equation}


{\bf DO WE NEED TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT VERIFYING AMPLITUDE RECONSTRUCTION?}


The simulation has successfully been run for up to $1,000,000$ time
steps, limited primarily by memory considerations due to the storage
necessary for phase and amplitude reconstruction. At this long
simulation duration, amplitudes and phases over six decades in
frequency are obtained.
