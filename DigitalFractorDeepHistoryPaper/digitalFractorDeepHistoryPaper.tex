\begin{abstract}
This paper outlines a method to achieve effective bandwidth of five or more decades in the approximation of a fractional order derivative. This constitutes an increase of two decades or more over current algorithms, such the Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) method based on continued fraction expansion, while demanding only slightly more computational steps and processor memory.

\section{Introduction}
\input{Introduction.tex}

\paragraph{Outline\\}
We will first briefly describe the current state of the art in fractional order operator approximation and then describe a novel approach based on successive binning of older data.

\begin{itemize} 
\item Section~\ref{algorithmDefn} will contain algorithm definitions. 
\item Section~\ref{results} will contain:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item  the amplitude and phase response of these algorithms for a large and small number of bins in the partition. 
	\item  an analysis of the computational resources required for the larger versus the smaller number of bins in the partition.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
