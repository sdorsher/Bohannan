I would like to submit this article,  "An efficient broadband deep memory algorithm for computing fractional order operations," to {\em Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation}.

This article was written as the culmination of a year long student research project supervised by Professor Gary Bohannan at Saint Cloud State University in Saint Cloud, Minnesota. I have a M.S. in Astronomy from Ohio State and am currently taking classes and doing research as a non-degree student at St. Cloud State while I wait for my M.S. in physics, pending in July from University of Minnesota.

My research advisor, Professor Bohannan, has been working in the field of fractors since his doctoral work at Montana State. He obtained his Ph.D. in 2000 and is currently an Adjunct Professor at St. Cloud State. While I am the corresponding author, if you have any questions for my research advisor, his contact information is:
