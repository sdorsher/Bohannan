I would like to submit this revised version of the article,  "An efficient broadband deep memory algorithm for computing fractional order operations," to {\em Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation}.

This article was written as the culmination of a year long student research project supervised by Professor Gary Bohannan at Saint Cloud State University in Saint Cloud, Minnesota. I have a M.S. in Astronomy from Ohio State and a M.S. in physics from University of Minnesota. Next year I will be returning to graduate school to pursue a Ph.D. in physics.

My research advisor, Professor Bohannan, has been working in the field of fractors since his doctoral work at Montana State. He obtained his Ph.D. in 2000 and is currently an Assistant Professor at St. Cloud State. While I am the corresponding author, if you have any questions for my research advisor, his contact information is:
