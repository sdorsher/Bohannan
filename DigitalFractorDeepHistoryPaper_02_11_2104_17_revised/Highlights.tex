{\bf Highlights}
\begin{itemize}
\item We add long term memory to the Grunwald differintegral by averaging the history.
\item Time can most successfully be binned exponentially, with longer bins toward the past.
\item The algorithm scales as the number of bins in memory per time step during run time. 
\item There is a 1.5 to 2.5 decade gain in bandwidth for 20 bins over IIR algorithms. 
\item We find a 5 decade constant-phase bandwidth, suitable for nonlinear control in a mcu.    

\end{itemize}
